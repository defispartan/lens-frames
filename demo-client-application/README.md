## Getting Started

1. Go to [WalletConnect Dashboard](https://cloud.walletconnect.com/) and get a Project ID.

2. Copy `.example.env.local` into a new file called `.env.local` and set your WalletConnect Project ID

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
